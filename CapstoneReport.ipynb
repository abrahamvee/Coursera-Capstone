    "<div style=\"text-right: justify\"> The automobile is one of the most common methods of transportation worlwide. And according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approximately 3,700 people die each in day in a car crash around the world, that amounts to nearly a million and a half people each year.\n",

    "It is important then to look for methods and prevention strategies to be able to reduce the amount of accidents. This would not only result in saving human lives but could reduce drastically costs, to parties such as the government, health organizations or even the individuals themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most contributing factors to driving accidents are: falling asleep at the wheel,loss of vehicle control (due to mechanical reasons or external e.g. the weather, other drivers), blind left turns, not staying in the proper lane.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of this factors can be attenuated, as is taking extra precautions during bad weather conditions or possibly even posponing the trip if possible.\n",

    "Tha purpose of this work is to see the relationship between certain driving conditions and to what type of accident is a driver exposed: severe, fatal or a slight driving accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of work could be of interest to the government: to be able to see the type of maintenance required on works, to insurance companies which can now have a better assessment of the probable type of accidents a driver can be involved in and finally to the drivers, it can help reduce the risks they take when driving. </div>"
